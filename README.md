# 🚀 KSP KOS Scripts 👩‍🚀👨🏽‍🚀

Just uploading my scripts so I don't lose them. Maybe I'll write some documentation later.

File structure:

-[/boot]: This is where the bootloaders live for a given rocket. If a connection is present, it connects with KSC, downloads and bundles all the required scripts for a given program and then executes the program.
- [/lib]: This is a bunch of reusable code modules that can be used to compose larger scripts.
- [/src]: This is where the primary scripts lib, right now there is a basic hover script and a script that launches and circularizes.

See [/notes.md](/notes.md) for additional notes.
